      <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>⅔ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13
        inch baking dish.

        In a separate bowl, mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each chicken breast in the oil mixture, then in the bread crumb
        mixture. Arrange the coated chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish,
        and top with any remaining bread crumb mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until chicken is no longer
        pink and juices run clear.
